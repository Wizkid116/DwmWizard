# DwmWizard
Shell script that builds and installs my custom DWM comfig

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wizkid116/DwmWizard.git
cd DwmWizard
chmod +x dwmwizard.sh
./dwmwizard.sh install
```

## Uninstall
If you ever want to uninstall DWM, issue the following command:
```bash
./dwmwizard.sh uninstall
```

## TODO
* Check for dependencies (possibly download them as well)
* (on top of the previous one) download urxvt and lightdm
* Compile all programs in parallel to improve speed
* (possibly) automatically apply user-defined patches
* add option to use the git repositories instead

## Donate
If you like my silly little project, then chuck me some Monero:
